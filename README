NAME
    Plack::Middleware::NoMultipleSlashes - Remove multiple slashes in your
    paths automatically

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
    Pure Plack:

        # in your app.psgi
        use Plack::Builder;

        my $app = sub { ... };

        builder {
            enable 'NoMultipleSlashes';
            $app;
        };

    Or in your Dancer app:

        # in config.yml
        plack_middlewares:
            - [ NoMultipleSlashes ]

DESCRIPTION
    In short: this removes all multiple slashes from your PATH_INFO. Read
    on, if you care why.

    Multiple slashes in requests are a common problem, which many share.
    Apparently, the RFC states that you should be able to expect different
    results from *http://server/* and *http://server//* (notice the second
    slash), so if the frameworks wish to maintain RFC compatibility, they
    cannot remove those extra slashes for you.

    While you can handle this issue in a reverse proxy, in a rewrite module
    or in your code, I find it more comfortable to have Plack take care of
    it in the thin layer called Middlewares.

    By enabling this middleware, all multiple slashes in your requests will
    automatically be cut. *//hello///world* becomes */hello/world*. Simple
    as that.

ORIGIN
    This Plack middleware was written originally after the issue was raised
    in the Dancer (<http://perldancer.org>) community.

    If you're using Dancer, this is the prefered way to handle this issue.
